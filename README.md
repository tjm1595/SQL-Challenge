# SQL-Challenge

Under the Data Modeling folder there is a PDF to the Entity Relationship Diagram I sketched which shows the relationships between each table and variable throughout the data.

Under the Data Engineering folder the main query file for the engineering exists. This file shows how the tables were created along with how the keys and data types were established for each table. It was during this step that each csv file was uploaded and included here. 

Under the Data Analysis folder the main query file exists for each query that needed for this assignment. The file demonstrates various forms of analysis and gives the code to each needed prompt.
